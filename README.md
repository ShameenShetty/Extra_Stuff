### * [Product of Digits of Sum](https://edabit.com/challenge/HrQoXJYqpYZ2Rqvtb)  
A problem from *edabit.com*, it asks to create a function that takes numbers as arguments, adds them together, and returns the product of digits until the answer is only 1 digit long.  

For example, 
1) sum_dig_prod(16, 28) ➞ 6
   * 16 + 28 = 44
   * 4 * 4 =  16
   * 1 * 6 = 6

2) sum_dig_prod(0) ➞ 0

3) sum_dig_prod(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) ➞ 2
